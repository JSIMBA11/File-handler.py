ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project demonstrates file handling and exception handling in Python.
It allows the user to provide a filename, reads the file, processes the contents by converting them to uppercase and numbering each line, and then writes the modified content to a new file.

The program also includes robust error handling to gracefully manage issues such as missing files, permission errors, or unexpected exceptions.

Key Features:

Reads content from a user-specified file

Writes a modified version of the content to a new file (modified_<filename>)

Handles common file-related errors (FileNotFound, PermissionError, etc.)

Demonstrates practical use of Pythonâ€™s try-except blocks
